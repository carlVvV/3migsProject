## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser
2. Ensure you're logged in with admin privileges
3. The dashboard will load with empty values initially

### Connecting to Database
The dashboard is designed to work with empty values initially. To connect to your database:

1. **Update the DashboardController**: Modify the methods in `DashboardController.php` to match your database schema
2. **Customize Queries**: Adjust the database queries in the controller methods
3. **Add Analytics**: Integrate with your analytics system for visitor tracking

### Key Methods to Customize

#### `getOrdersData()`
- Fetches order statistics for current and previous month
- Calculates percentage changes
- Customize based on your order status values

#### `getUsersData()`
- User count and new user registration
- Modify user creation date field if different

#### `getWebsiteStats()`
- Placeholder for visitor tracking
- Integrate with Google Analytics or similar services

#### `getBestSellers()`
- Product performance based on order items
- Adjust the join query based on your schema

#### `getCustomerRetention()`
- Monthly retention calculation
- Implement your retention logic

## Customization

### Styling
- **Colors**: Modify the CSS variables in `dashboard.css`
- **Layout**: Adjust the Tailwind classes in `dashboard.blade.php`
- **Charts**: Customize Chart.js options in the JavaScript

### Data Structure
The dashboard expects this data structure:

```javascript
{
  orders: {
    completed: 0,
    pending: 0,
    cancelled: 0,
    completedChange: 0,
    pendingChange: 0,
    cancelledChange: 0
  },
  users: {
    total: 0,
    change: 0
  },
  website: {
    visitors: 0,
    productViews: 0,
    newOrders: 0,
    cancelled: 0
  },
  bestSellers: [],
  orderStats: []
}
```

### Adding New Features
1. **New API Endpoint**: Add route in `web.php`
2. **Controller Method**: Create method in `DashboardController`
3. **Frontend Integration**: Update JavaScript in dashboard view
4. **Styling**: Add CSS classes as needed

## API Endpoints

  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "orders": {...},
    "users": {...},
    "website": {...},
    "bestSellers": [...],
    "orderStats": [...]
  }
}
```

### GET `/admin/filtered-orders`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Empty Dashboard**
   - Check if routes are properly configured
   - Verify admin middleware is working
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

2. **Data Not Loading**
   - Verify database connections
   - Check if models exist and are properly configured
   - Review API endpoint responses

3. **Styling Issues**
   - Ensure `dashboard.css` is accessible
   - Check if Tailwind CSS is loading
   - Verify Font Awesome icons are loading

### Debug Mode
Enable Laravel debug mode to see detailed error messages:
```php
// .env
APP_DEBUG=true
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Queries
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Use eager loading for relationships
- Implement query caching for static data

### Frontend Optimization
- Minify CSS and JavaScript in production
- Use CDN for external libraries
- Implement lazy loading for charts

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Access**: Ensure proper authentication and authorization
2. **SQL Injection**: Use Laravel's query builder and Eloquent ORM
3. **XSS Protection**: Laravel provides built-in protection
4. **CSRF Protection**: Enabled by default in Laravel
